Our project focused on enhancing mountain bikes and cargo bicycles with simple electrification kits, extending ride time and towing capabilities. Additionally, we've designed a motorbike ambulance for the Dhorpatan valley, providing vital emergency transportation to the nearest town of Burtibag. This initiative aims to bridge the mobility gap for rural communities.",

The initiative aimed to address the rapid spread of the COVID-19 disease by devising a strategy to minimize human exposure through the deployment of robots for disinfection procedures within hospital settings in Kathmandu. The study also anticipated that this approach would prove instrumental in reducing the likelihood of secondary infections among COVID-19 patients, thanks to the effective removal of bacterial and fungal pathogens responsible for nosocomial infections.
