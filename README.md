# TU Searchable Directory

Deployed at : http://nqbjqywexniaccq.bct.itclub.pp.ua/

Think of the TU Searchable Directory as a super helpful website. It’s like
an online book that has all the details about the colleges and schools under Tribhuvan
University. This includes information about the teachers and staff too. The cool thing is
that you can use it anytime and anywhere because it works on your computer and even
on your phone.
Imagine you’re a student or someone who wants to know about the colleges and the
people working there. Instead of searching through lots of papers, you can just go to
this website and find all the info you need.
